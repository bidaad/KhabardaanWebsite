        <p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, when we discuss nutrition on a weight loss path, our goal is to educate people about the right and principled way of eating. Simply put, the goal of dieting people is to correct their nutritional patterns ...</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">So when a person comes to us for the first time in order to lower his weight, we first take a complete biography of his food pattern to find out what foods he eats and then, based on the pattern of food and the table of his own family, we will consider. Of course, a logical program that can help lose weight.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The question here for many is that when they first come to a nutritionist, they get a diet that is almost like a loved one, a partner, or a family member. With this in mind, can individuals, without a dietitian, use their diets to get their desired results? The answer is no doubt "no"! Why? The answer to this question can be easily stated with a simple and objective example.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>● Diets are exclusive!</strong></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">You suppose, how many people are you and all going to go to a wedding party or even mourning to go to the tailor and order a dress. Certainly, all of you will choose dark-colored fabrics for mourning and lighter colors for wedding ceremonies. Now some people prefer to dress shorter, and some would love to dress up, and on the other hand, some of their heads are shorter and thinner, and others are more fat or louder. If your height is tall and slim, you can still borrow and wear your wedding dress, which is short and obese, for your wedding party? Absolutely not. Although the color and style of your friend's clothes may be suitable for a wedding, but the dress is only sewn to him, and you may find a very bad appearance when you put it up. With this simple example, you've probably noticed that a nutritionist will consider each person's diet according to his or her own needs, and as individuals with different sizes and tastes can not afford to dress each other, they can not Share their diet with each other.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>● Diet based diet</strong></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We ask the person who comes to us for the first time, asking them what kind of food they eat in their family dishes so that we can see that they are from traditional dishes or exotic! Then, at the onset of a diet program, it takes about 60 to 70 percent of the foods it eats in order to avoid being tired or bored. Now that many see that almost the first diet plan they receive from a dietitian is similar to that of a friend or co-worker, it's because our people usually eat the same foods throughout the day. For example, if you tell several of your friends that they will bring you a breakfast for breakfast tomorrow, most of them will most likely bring a bunch of bread and cheese and maybe only one, two people will bring milk and cereal, or a container of halibut. .</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">So you see that this early similarity of diets is due to the similarity of the foods we eat. But in general, anyone has the right to model another regime. Because as I said, each person's diet is planned according to his or her own taste and desire, and other people may have a different taste to him than others, and they will get tired too quickly with the modeling of the diet of others, Bringing their weights. Let me do this with a simple example.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Suppose that you have come to a nutritionist for dieting and lowering your weight, and he is also asking questions that you are more interested in pasta than bread or rice, and for the sake of your interest in your diet. As much as possible, you have included pasta instead of rice or bread in your diet as a source of carbohydrates. Now, if your friend who hates the macaroni wants to do the same thing to your diet, surely he'll be disappointed with this diet within a very short time, and it's just a matter of complaining what this diet is! On the other hand, at the beginning of the diet, we may give a person who needs 2200 kcal of energy per day to give a 1200 kilocalories diet, give the person who needs 2,000 calories a diet of 1,200 calories and a person who needs 1800 calories a day. , We will again give a 1,200 kcal regime.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Each of these three people, when they compare their regime, sees that the regime is the same, but they do not know that behind the scenes is something else and we do not expect the same results from their diet. Although the calorie intake is all the same. In fact, we expect the first person to lose one kilogram, the second one to 800 grams and the third one to 600 grams, because their daily needs vary in energy. It was another example to make you well aware of the fact that the regime of each person, just like the clothes of a tone, is just and right for him!</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>● The philosophy of dieting</strong></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, in the diet, his own mistakes are taken and the diet is adjusted according to his needs and tastes. Of course, people can teach a healthy eating pattern to everyone around them, and it can be commonplace in the community, but no one can share their diet with others. In general, looking hard at a short time to lose weight is a mistake, and someone who wants to lose weight and always healthy should change this look and correct his food pattern and correct it. Eating, having a healthy and healthy bodyweight, rather than always looking for weight loss with unhealthy diets.<br /><span style="color: #808080;">Source: salamat.ir</span></p>
